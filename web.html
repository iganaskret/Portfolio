                Theme "Basic Web" was the first theme we were introduced to during the course. During 4 weeks of this theme I have submitted all 5 assignments, the last of them being my first responsive website. It was my first ever contact with Adobe programmes, design principles, creating responsive websites, and second or third attempt in my life to create a basic website in HTML and CSS. The website looks pretty simple, but almost everything in this theme was new to me. I also learned how to organise my work while creating the website, for example through categorising images.
            </p>

            <div class="miniatures">
                <img src="img/MOBILE.png" alt="mobile version of my website" class="mini">
                <img src="img/TABLET.png" alt="tablet version of my website" class="mini">
                <img src="img/WEB.png" alt="web version of my website" class="mini">
            </div>

            The whole website is in contemporary style, which was given to me at the beginning of the theme.

            The most important parts of this website are:
            
            <h3> moodboard </h3>
            <img src="img/MoodBoard.png" alt="moodboard">
            <p>
                While creating my moodboard, I used the figure-ground phenomena- I placed the objects one on another, giving the impression of a hand-made collage. I chose the keywords that match the given style, as well as my idea of the website I want to create. I have implemented different colours, patterns, shapes and textures, as well as pictures from different categories- from an artwork to a barthroom. The background of the moodboard is white, because I strongly associate the contemporary style with it, and it made all the elements stand out. Also, it matched my first keyword, which was "simple".
            </p>
            
            <h3> colours and typography </h3>

            <p>
                For the website, I used the same color palette as in my moodboard. I focused on soft colors and pastels. When it comes to typography, I changed the font, because during the trunk test I discovered, that users don't think it's understandable enough. I still wanted to have a typeface with a handwritten feel to it, so I purchased 'Lilypaly' and used it for headers.
            </p>
            <img src="img/font%20sample.png" alt="font sample">
            <p>
                This font imitates modern calligraphy, and was contrasting with the font I used for subheadings and text, which was 'Montserrat'. It's a Google Font, very simple, minimalistic and sans-serif, with good readability.
            </p>
            <h3> design principles </h3>
            <p>
                When creating the website, I used a lot of design principles I was introduced to in this theme.
            </p>
            <img src="img/menu.png" alt="menu">
            <p>
                For example for the menu, I used the Gestalt Principle of closure and proximity (I put the navigation options in a box, close to one another and in distance to other pieces of text). For the content, I used different contrasts (size, shape and weight) to distinguish titles and subtitles from the body text.
            </p>
            <h3> logo </h3>
            <img src="img/Logo%20copy.png" alt="logo" id="logo">
            <p>
                This is the logo I sketched and then outlined in Illustrator speciffically for this website. I used my initials, the letters "i" and "n" and combined them together in a handwritten style to match the aesthetic of my website. I then added a circle around it, because geometric shapes are one of the features of contemporary style.
            </p>
            <h3> code </h3>
            <p>
                Coding the website was definitely the most challenging part of this theme. I have learned a lot, but there's still a lot I don't know how to do. What I consider the most important things I was introduced to in this theme code-wise, it would be the burger menu and media queries.
            </p>

            <div class="miniatures">
                <img src="img/code1.png" alt="code burger menu" class="code">
                <img src="img/code2.png" alt="code responsive" class="code">

            </div>

            <p>
                After I have recently discovered why it's called a "burger" menu, my skills of creating this kind of navigation system is completed. I then used it on other websites of mine, like for example this one, because I like it that much.
            </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to coding the media queries, it was a difficult part, especially changing the position of the menu, but at the end it turned out to be acceptable. I coded 3 different sizes of screens- a phone, tablet and web screens.
