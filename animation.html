                This project was definitely my favourite one to make. I even found myself helping my classmates! I didn't know JavaScript before, but in High School I was coding in C++ and once I saw the similarities, I was able to code these simple animations and enjoy the process. Next projects showed me, that I actually have a lot to learn when it comes to JavaScript, but as long as I am given enough time, I can more or less solve given problems. It was also the time when we were introduced to CSS animations, which I didn't know existed. I have learned to apply them and turn them on and off through JS. My favourite one is the "glow" animation, which my classmates and I have came up together using help from the internet, but writing down it in our codes on our own. I am especially fond of the pulsing of the glow there.

                This is a documentation of an animated story, which I have invented, created the characters, prepared style tile, storyboard and animated one small bit of it. This was a project that required skills in Illustrator, HTML, CSS, and the knowledge from the previous theme, regarding storyboards and dramatic curve. I have created my little Avocado and Tomato from scratch in Illustrator, what rewarded me with getting to know this tool a little bit better.

                This was also the assignment where we were creating our own characters, had to think of all of their features, both physical and psychological. We were combining what we already know how to do with something new, what made it less overwhelming. I had an opportunity to learn how to think like a storyteller. But the most challenging part for me was to create the animation, especially the sprite sheet. I couldn't make the background stop moving and even in the final version it shakes a little bit.

                This project was challenging because we didn't have a lot of time for it, and in addition, I had a fever at the time. Our animation didn't turned out how we wanted it to, but despite the limitation of our skills, time and health, we managed to created a semi-working one. Even though I was sick, I managed to spend a whole day coding in JavaScript, making mistakes and learning from them. I wish we had more time, because my partner and I would be able to improve our project, but we didn't. Fortunately while working on the interactive production later during the theme, I was able to learn JS to the point that I would do this project differently now.

            <p>
                Project Pool was something I missed at school because of the sickness, that have started when I was working on the Interactive animation, and I only managed to do one aspect of it. I created a to-do list that you can add elements to. Unfortunately I wasn't able to code moving tasks from the "to-do" part to the "done" part. I enjoyed the process of coding, even though it was very challenging for me and I needed a lot of help from online tutorials. After this project, I was engaging more in coding while teamworking and my skills have improved. I want this to be my main area of focus in the upcoming semesters.

                In this project, I was able to work on my coding skills. Even though I wasn't the coder in the group, I was helping the colleague that was. I was the one that has for example created the main character- Punks Bunny. I was also coding the Easter Eggs, like the playing guitar or the poster. During this project I was mostly using my coding and Illustrator skills, my knowledge of Animation Principles and the style of punk. Once again, we were working creatively within boundries, what is a good excersise before starting the real job as a multimedia designer. We have also learned what personas are and how to define them. During this project we had to make a lot of iterations, because some of our ideas weren't approved by the teachers. For example we had to change the bunny 5 times before we added it into the animation. I could definitely see my progress in killing my darlings too! While working on this project, the colaboration agreement was useful and was keeping us on track.

                Our screencast is very formal and not creative due to misunderstanding of the task description. Once we saw other group's screencasts, we regreted taking this so seriously. It is based on a script we have written together. It was another good exercise for documenting the work, because we had summed up together everything from our target audience, which we had defined at the beginning, to the results of the user tests. We have showed there not only the final version, but also our first attempts, for example on personas collage. It was also another project to use our video editing skills, as well as practice doing voiceovers.
