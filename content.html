                Theme ,,Basic Content" was mostly focused on creating a microsite for cyclists in Copenhagen as a group. The first step was setting up the group and writing the collaboration agreement. In the course of the following weeks I learned a lot about groupwork in an international environment. We all had different ideas and managed to discuss them and make decisions in a really good working atmosphere. I consider the experience of working in a team with people from different countries to be one of the most valuable lessons I had during this course so far.

            <p>
                At the beginning we all had various ideas, which we were consequently narrowing down, to the point when we had a clear goal- to create 3 different routes for tourists depending on their skills. Our side goal was to include the main rules of cycling in Denmark, what we also managed to do.
                The process of creating the XD prototype improved my skils in Adobe XD, which I only used once before, while creating the prototype of the responsive website from previous theme. We also used Adobe Illustrator, for example for drawing the legs that symbolise different kinds of cyclists. During this project, I was responsible also for creating the style tile, looking for the typefaces and choosing color palette. We also tested the prototype, what gave me a better understanding of how people can react to my projects and helped us improve our final microsite.

                This was my first ever attempt on producing a video. In my team, I was shooting and helping with editing. We only had two days to complete this assignment, so we went for a simple plot, something we could shoot at home. I've never used Premiere Pro before, but the results of our work received a surprisingly good feedback in class. Now I know that we could have made some things differently, for example the transition to a memory of the girl should be more clear, because not everyone understood what we mean in this part of the video. What I think is also worth mentioning is our Easter Egg we added at the end of the video. My groupmate accidentally hit herself in the head while shooting, and I captured both the exact moment of it happening, as well as the sound. We added this short scene at the end of our video as a "behind the scenes" clip.

            <p>
                The next part of the theme was creating a video for the microsite. We started with brainstorming all the ideas we had. We ended up having two- an add for the website showing people from different categories using it, or a tutorial on biking in Copenhagen. At the end we chose the first option. We have learned a lot about the process of creating a film and we followed the guidelines while creating our own short movie. The first step was choosing a title, which we didn't struggle too much with, because we have used the title of the website, which is "Bike Your Way Through Copenhagen", not only we liked it and considered it catchy, but also because the video was supposed to promote the website and should be associated with it. The next step was defining the theme of the video. It was supposed to describe the essence of the story. Our theme was "Choose your level and bike around Copenhagen". Our treatment, since it was a short movie, was also not very long, but we have covered the whole story. We wrote down how we want our video to look like, who are the characters, what are they supposed to do, where and when we're planning on shooting the video.

            <p>
                We had multiple attempts on making the storyboard. At the beginning we weren't going deep enough into details and it wasn't approved by the teachers. Even though the final version of the video looks slightly different than our storyboard, it was a very important part of the process of making the film. We had to focus on things we didn't think about before, like the length of the shots, the background sound or camera angles. It was a very proffesional approach to creating an advertisement video. The changes to this pre-planned story were added in the process of shooting, where we saw how much time we actually need for specific scenes. In our storyboard, we had to roughly estimate it. We also changed a little bit while editing, when we decided to add a voiceover.

            <p>
                Creating the documentation wasn't difficult, because we had all the materials prepared beforehand, and we only needed to put it all together. During the course of the studies I have really started to appreciate good documenting the creative process. I was taught everything from scratch and now I use this knowledge even when I am doing my own small private projects, because I see how helpful it is. <br> We have made our documentation file look similar to the website, using the same style and colors.

                This is the final product. In our group, we had one more experienced coder, which enabled us to add a map and a gallery of photos. The website matches the style tile we created beforehand, and includes our promotional video and tips for tourists. It was very helpful to have a XD prototype to rely on. This project was a great insight into a multimedia designer's work- we were given a task and had to come up with the solutions, we worked as a team in an international environment, we split responsibilities, we had a certain level of freedom, but still we worked within boundries of the task description. We all have practised our skills in Illustrator, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, XD and InDesign. I enjoyed working on creating this add-like video and this was actually the project where I think I have learned to kill my darlings- we all had so many ideas and were constantly forced to argue them, choose the best option, give up on something we liked. This was an eye-opening project, but a very pleasant to work on.
