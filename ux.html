                This theme has showed me a new approach to groupwork. With only 5 days to do so, we created a prototype of Fronter's messaging website. Having split task this big into smaller chunks helped us succesfully accomplish the sprint. We were introduced to various methods of working, like for example the Crazy 8, which we used and which has helped us a lot with coming up with the final ideas. I have also learned new methods of making decisions in groups, through the Decider and through voting, where one has multiple votes and the Decider's votes are worth more. The idea of spliting the work into mapping, sketching, deciding, prototyping and testing is a useful one. This way of working really suited me. We managed to brainstorm a lot of ideas and if only were we capable of coding them, we would most cerainly do so. We let our imagination run wild sometimes, dreaming of having an option to screenshare or hand in directly from the chat. This was an excersise on our creativity as well and we did very well!

                This was the first assignment that wasn't approved. My login page works only when someone clicks directly on the word "SUBMIT", what wasn't obvious for the teacher using it, therefore the user journey I created couldn't be seen and judged. It's a pity, because I have worked hard on making animated drop-down menu and carefully following KEA's design guide. I even made something that imitates sending a message via chat. Not only did I practise coding, but also designing. What I found particularly helpful was "talking code". I do this every time I'm stuck- just split the big problem into solvable steps. It also helps in seeking help from colleagues or online tutorials, because I am able to precisely define what it is I don't know how to do.

                This project was strongly based on the previous one in terms of the main ideas. We have changed the visual part of it, going for more "Discord-like" feel, and changed options so that they suited a mobie app. It wasn't my first contact with Adobe XD, but it definitely felt like one, when we were shown the UI Kits. That's one of the most important things I learned while working on this app. It was also my first attempt on designing an app, which, frankly speaking, differs from designing a mobile website.

                In the course of the studies I discovered, that even though making the documentation isn't my favourite part of being a multimedia designer, it's definitely a very important one. I had learned how to describe my thoughts and creative process in the way which is understandable for people from the outside. This file shows my journey throughout the UX theme, from User Biefs, through User Journey to the results of my interviews and tests. In this theme I summed up my knowledge of testing my products and learned some more methods, like discussion in focus groups or Think Aloud test.
